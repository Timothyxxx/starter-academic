I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), guided by Dr. [Tao Yu(core)](https://taoyds.github.io/), Dr. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/), and Prof. [Kao, Benjamin C.M.](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=TwSParMAAAAJ&hl=en). I also receive advise from [Victor Zhong](https://www.victorzhong.com/). My primary research interest is in Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. I am passionate about key problems in building applications to liberate human employees from labor. Currently, I focus mainly on manipulating large language models for NLP and Robotics tasks ([UnifiedSKG](https://github.com/HKUNLP/UnifiedSKG), [Binder](https://lm-code-binder.github.io/), [Text2reward](https://text-to-reward.github.io/), [OpenAgents](https://github.com/xlang-ai/openagents), and [OSWorld](https://os-world.github.io/), [OSWorld-G](https://osworld-grounding.github.io/)). I aim to approach them in an agent-centric way for modeling in 2023, 2024 and 2025.
