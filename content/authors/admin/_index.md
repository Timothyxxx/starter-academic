I am currently a final-year undergraduate student inÂ [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/). 
My major is Computer Science (stream to Natural Language Processing in the third year). 
I have done research intern at [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/),Â [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), 
supervised by Ph.D. candidate [Libo Qin](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~lbqin/) and Prof. [Wanxiang Che](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~car/). 

After that, I will join the [NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.hku.hk/) of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) as an incoming Ph.D. in 2022 Fall guided by Dr. [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/) and Dr. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/). (And we are [hiring](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/TU19MDa4nKp7ajVwKFbJqg), join us!)



Recent progressðŸ’¡.

2021-08, One of our work has been accepted to EMNLP 2021 (main).
