I am a first year Ph.D. student of [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), guided by Dr. [Tao Yu(core)](https://taoyds.github.io/), Dr. [Lingpeng Kong](https://ikekonglp.github.io/) and Prof. [Kao, Benjamin C.M.](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=TwSParMAAAAJ&hl=en). My main research interest is in Natural Language Processing. I care about building innovative SaaS application services of NLP for companies to empower their employees. Currently I focus most on manipulating language model to solve/revolute code generation task and traditional semantic parsing task([Binder](https://lm-code-binder.github.io/)), which is essential for building interface between human and structured knowledge([UnifiedSKG](https://github.com/HKUNLP/UnifiedSKG)) in Data Science. I am also very familiar with the techniques about building task-oriented dialog system(Spoken Language Understanding: [Awesome-SLU survey](https://github.com/yizhen20133868/Awesome-SLU-Survey), Dialogue State Tracking: [IC-DST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08568) etc.), is an example of a game changer by a large language model(2022). 
Previously, as an undergraduate student, I have done research intern at [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/),Â [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/), supervised by Ph.D. candidate [Libo Qin](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~lbqin/) and Prof. [Wanxiang Che](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~car/).
