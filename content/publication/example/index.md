abstract: "Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) aims to extract the semantics
  frame of user queries, which is a core component in a task-oriented dialog
  system. With the burst of deep neural networks and the evolution of
  pre-trained language models, the research of SLU has obtained significant
  breakthroughs. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive survey
  summarizing existing appproaches and recent trends, which motivated the work
  presented in this article. In this paper, we survey recent advances and new
  frontiers in SLU. Specifically, we give a thorough review of this research
  field, covering different aspects including (1) new taxonomy: we provide a new
  perrspective for SLU filed, including single model vs. joint model, implicit
  joint modeling vs. explicit joint modeling in joint model, non pre-trained
  paradigm vs. pre-trained paradigm; (2) new frontiers: some emerging areas in
  complex SLU as well as the corresponding challenges; (3) abundant open-source
  resources: to help the community, we have collected, organized the related
  papers, baseline projects and leaderboard on a public website1 where SLU
  researchers could directly access to the recent progress. We hope that this
  survey can shed a light on future research in SLU field.\n"
